              <h1>Web Development</h1>
              <p>Web development is primarily divided into two main areas:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Front-end Development:</strong> Focuses on the design, layout, and interactivity of websites using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is what users see and interact with.</li>
                    <li><strong>Back-end Development:</strong> Manages the server-side logic and database interactions, ensuring that the website can handle requests, process data, and deliver content efficiently. This includes technologies like Node.js, Python, and databases such as MySQL and MongoDB.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Databases are a critical part of the back-end. They store the data that websites and applications rely on, whether it's user information, content, or transaction records. Understanding how to design, manage, and query databases is an essential skill for any back-end developer.
